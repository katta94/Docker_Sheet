How docker works architecture view:
CLI use for executing a command. Docker client uses the appropriate API payload. POSTs to the correct API endpoint
Docker deamon receives instructions. Docker deamon calls containerd to start a new container.
Docker daemon uses gRPC (a CRUD style API). containerd creates an OCI bundle from the Docker image.
Tells runc to create a container using the OCI bundle.runc interfaces with the OS kernal to get the constructs needed to create a container
This includes namespaces, cgroups, etc.. Container process starts as a child process.
runc exits once the container starts. Process is complete, and container is running.

Enable and start Docker:
sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker

Add cloud_user to the docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker cloud_user
